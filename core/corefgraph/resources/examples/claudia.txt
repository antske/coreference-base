The disappearance of York University chef Claudia Lawrence is now being treated as suspected murder, North Yorkshire Police said. However detectives said they had not found any proof that the 35-year-old, who went missing on 18 March, was dead. Her father Peter Lawrence made a direct appeal to his daughter to contact him five weeks after she disappeared. His plea came at a news conference held shortly after a 10,000 reward was offered to help find Miss Lawrence. Crimestoppers said the sum they were offering was significantly higher than usual because of public interest in the case.
